When I yank code into a `smartparens-mode` buffer and encounter an issue where a closing parenthesis is missing, I can manually turn off  `smartparens-mode`, add the closing parenthesis, and then re-enable `smartparens-mode`.

While this approach works, itâ€™s a bit inconvenient. There is a simpler way to correct unbalanced parenthesis. According to this StackOverflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26248310 "answer") `quote-insert` (bound by default to <kbd>C-q</kbd>) is unaffected by `paredit-mode`(and also `smartparens-mode`). Simply place your cursor at the point that you want to insert parenthesis, press <kbd>C-q</kbd>, then enter the missing closing parenthesis.
